- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin - I'm new to Github so still learning...
- 👀 I’m interested in developing reasoning and thinking agents capable of adapting to the training needs of humans and teams.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, deep learning, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my knowledge on machine and deep learning alogirthms. Their capabilities, limitations, and implementations.
- 📫 How to reach me: on github?
